# Statistical Tool Simulations

A researcher or analyst often use statistical tools during data analysis.
Tools such as 1-way or k-way ANOVA is used to make sure if there is significant different between the mean of groups/levels.
A Chi-square goodness-of-fit test is used to compare if the data they observed are coming from a specific distributions.
Meanwhile various other statistical tools are performed for a specific reason, which is, to help convince the researcher
about the characteristics of the data that they have in hand (at least from a statistical viewpoint).

This notebook is written as a platform for me to test/experiment with various statistical testing so that
I am familiar and convince with the usage of it. Feel free to use, comment and do whatever you like with this notebook.
Do let me know in case you find any error in the simulations. ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„
